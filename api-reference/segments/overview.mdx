Segments are blazing fast one-time snapshots that query an audience by defined filters across different chains.

**For example you might want to query:**

- All wallets that minted at least 3 Bored Ape Yacht Clubs
- All wallets that hold at least 100 DAI and own 10 CloneX
- All wallets that own a Bored Ape with Golden Fur.


## Supported Filter Types
We currently do support different filter types on Ethereuem & Polygon:

- Holders: Get wallets by their ERC20 & ERC721 Holdings.
- Minters: Wallets that minted a specific NFT.
- Buyers / Sellers: Wallets that bought or sold a specific NFT / Token.
